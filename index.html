    <h1>How the QR Code Generator Works</h1>

    <p>Have you ever wondered how those square, pixelated patterns on products and advertisements, known as QR codes, are created? This HTML page explains the magic behind a simple Python script that allows you to generate QR codes from text or links.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: The User-Friendly Window</h2>
    <p>When you run this program, a user-friendly window pops up on your computer screen. It's a bit like an app, but simpler, with buttons and a text entry box.</p>

    <h2>Step 2: Type in Your Text or Link</h2>
    <p>In this window, there's a place where you can type in any text or a web link (URL) that you want to turn into a QR code. It's as easy as typing a message on your phone.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: Click the Magic Button</h2>
    <p>After you've entered the text or link, you just need to click a button that says "Generate QR Code and Save." This is where the magic begins!</p>

    <h2>Step 4: The QR Code Appears</h2>
    <p>The program gets to work and creates the QR code for your text or link. It looks like a black-and-white puzzle square. This QR code can be scanned by a phone or camera to quickly access the website or information you entered.</p>

    <h2>Step 5: Choose Where to Save</h2>
    <p>The program asks where you want to save this QR code. It's like picking a spot to store your favorite picture. You get to choose a name for the file and decide where on your computer you want to put it.</p>

    <h2>Step 6: Saving the QR Code</h2>
    <p>Once you've decided where to save it, the program saves the QR code as a picture on your computer. It's like taking a photo and storing it on your computer's photo album.</p>

    <h2>Step 7: Your QR Code is Ready</h2>
    <p>Finally, the program tells you that your QR code is ready. It even shows you where it saved it on your computer. You can use this QR code to quickly share the information or link you encoded in it.</p>

    <p>That's it! This simple program makes creating QR codes as easy as pie. Whether you want to share a link or a special message, it's a handy tool for generating QR codes whenever you need them.</p>
